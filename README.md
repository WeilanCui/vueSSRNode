# Vue App with SSR

## Purpose

Implementing "Hello World" app using SSR. All knowledge gained from prototyping an SSR Vue app will be applied to a Deno implementation.

Any errors that appear in the Node version will be helpful for informing what is needed to consider while making an equivalent port to Deno.
